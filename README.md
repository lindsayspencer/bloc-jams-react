## Project Overview

Bloc Jams is an audio player web app I created using the JavaScript framework React.js, which uses ECMAScript 6 classes to establish inheritance between components and to ensure a one-way data flow. The app's functionality includes:

- React Router for smooth and fast page transitions

- Player bar with audio controls, including working volume and time range inputs

- Play/Pause icons, depending on song status
